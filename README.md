# Bharat-Intern-task


For this virtual internship, I was told to perform two tasks.

Task 01: Stock Price prediction using LSTM
- LSTM has the capability of storing past information abd hence is very useful in predicting stock prices. This is because the prediction of a future stock price is dependent on the previous prices.
- I have used yFinance to obtain the stock prices of AAPL over the last 5 years. yFinance is an open-source Python library that allows us to acquire stock data from Yahoo Finance without any cost.


Task 02: Titanic Survival Prediction 
- This project is used to predict whether a passenger will survive on the titanic or not.
- I have used kaggle to obtain data for the following.
- We did some basic data visualisations where we got to know that women are most likely to survive than men. Even people in third class had less chance of survival.
